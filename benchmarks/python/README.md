# Overview

This is the python benchmark, comparing TimSort, QuickSort, and 'Recursive-Bucket-Sort' against one another.

Just to make it clear, the TimSort and QuickSort implementations were made by the GeeksForGeeks team. The only modifications
were removing their 'main' functions.

# Tools required

* Docker
* make

# Running

If you want to run the CPython test, run `make cpython` and then a `cpython.csv` will be created.

If you want to run the Pypy test, run `make pypy` and then a `pypy.csv` will be created.

If you want to run both, run `make both`.

# Results

You can upload your CSV files at https://algorithms.chatha.dev, do note that you'll need an API key which you can contact bradley@chatha.dev (until Josh takes full control), or Josh directly for a key.
